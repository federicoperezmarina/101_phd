# LLM-Based Synthetic Datasets: Applications and Limitations in Toxicity Detection

## Abstract
Large Language Model (LLM)-based synthetic data is an emerging field, particularly for training classifiers to detect online toxicity. The study evaluates the effectiveness of generative models in producing synthetic data for toxicity detection across six datasets. The research examines the performance of classifiers trained with combinations of original and synthetic data and analyzes the limitations and advantages of synthetic oversampling. Key findings indicate the limited success in improving hate speech detection with synthetic data, though significant benefits were observed in detecting patronizing and condescending language. Further research is needed to enhance data quality and filtering methods.

## 1. Introduction
The introduction discusses the transformative impact of large language models (LLMs), especially those based on Transformer architectures, in natural language processing (NLP). It explores the potential of synthetic data, focusing on its applications in sensitive tasks like toxicity detection. This research leverages fine-tuned GPT-3 Curie models for generating synthetic text and investigates three primary research questions on the effectiveness of synthetic data for toxicity detection in diverse languages and tasks.

The study concludes that GPT-3 Curie has limited effectiveness in generating synthetic data for hate speech detection but shows promise for non-hateful toxic language tasks, like patronizing and condescending language detection. The importance of rigorous filtering and the use of techniques like SMOTE for addressing class imbalance are emphasized. The potential of synthetic data augmentation for NLP is highlighted, though further improvements in generative models and methodologies are necessary.
