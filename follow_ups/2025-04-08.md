## Prompt Engineering
- Prompt Engineering survey[Prompt Engineering Survey](https://github.com/federicoperezmarina/101_phd/tree/main/papers/2402.07927)
- The page [https://www.promptingguide.ai/](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) allows us to understand better how are the possible inputs of a prompt

## Next Steps
1. Coding various prompt engineering techniques, group and doprompting by structure prompt
	- secuence
	- tree -> paths
	- graphs -> cycle
2. Work in the output:
    - direct output
    - iterative output 
    - creating new prompt as an output for automate it
3. Look for a validator tool of logs that validate it automatically
4. Know the context windows of the different models
5. Use another free model
6. Use OpenAi | Antropic | Gemini model
7. Use open source reasoning model
8. Use OpenAi reasoning model
