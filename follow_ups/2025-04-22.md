# Follow-up 22-04-2025

## Last Follow-up Actions
1. Coding various prompt engineering techniques, group and doprompting by structure prompt
	- secuence
	- tree -> paths
	- graphs -> cycle
2. Know the context windows of the different models
3. Use another free model
4. Use OpenAi | Antropic | Gemini model
5. Use open source reasoning model
6. Use OpenAi reasoning model
7. Look for a validator tool of logs that validate it automatically
8. Work in the output:
    - direct output
    - iterative output 
    - creating new prompt as an output for automate it

## Things DONE
- Starting with Chain of Though as first technique of prompt engineering
- Two papers:
    -

## Next Steps
-
