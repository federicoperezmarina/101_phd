# Follow-up 22-04-2025

## Last Follow-up Actions
1. Coding various prompt engineering techniques, group and doprompting by structure prompt
	- secuence
	- tree -> paths
	- graphs -> cycle
2. Know the context windows of the different models
3. Use another free model
4. Use OpenAi | Antropic | Gemini model
5. Use open source reasoning model
6. Use OpenAi reasoning model
7. Look for a validator tool of logs that validate it automatically
8. Work in the output:
    - direct output
    - iterative output 
    - creating new prompt as an output for automate it

## Things DONE
- Starting with Chain of Though as first technique of prompt engineering
- Two papers:
    - [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://github.com/federicoperezmarina/101_phd/tree/main/papers/2201.11903)
        - A chain of thought is a series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final output, and we refer to this approach as chain-of-thought prompting.
        - Experiments on arithmetic, symbolic and commonsense reasoning.
        - Instead of adding a full chain of thought it will give errors in some prompts. (example: [chain_of_thought_full_3.py](https://github.com/federicoperezmarina/101_phd/blob/main/code/prompt_engineering_techniques/1_secuence/chain_of_thougth_full_3.py))
    - [Automatic Chain of Thought Prompting in Large Language Models](https://github.com/federicoperezmarina/101_phd/tree/main/papers/2210.03493)
