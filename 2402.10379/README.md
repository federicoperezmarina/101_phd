#### Title:
**DataDreamer: A Tool for Synthetic Data Generation and Reproducible LLM Workflows**

#### Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools for NLP research in various tasks, including synthetic data generation, evaluation, fine-tuning, and distillation. However, challenges due to model scale, closed-source nature, and lack of standardized tooling hinder open science and reproducibility. This paper introduces **DataDreamer**, an open-source Python library enabling researchers to implement advanced LLM workflows while promoting best practices for reproducibility. The library is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/datadreamer-dev/DataDreamer).

#### Introduction:
Large language models have revolutionized NLP research through the prompt-and-predict paradigm. However, issues such as closed-source accessibility, technical complexity, and prompt sensitivity hinder reproducibility and sharing. **DataDreamer** addresses these challenges by providing a standardized interface for implementing workflows like synthetic data generation, fine-tuning, and alignment while ensuring reproducibility with caching, reproducibility fingerprints, and open science practices.
